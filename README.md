# *SQL Data Cleaning Project*🧹

**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing raw employee layoff data from around the world using SQL to improve data quality and ensure accuracy. The goal is to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare the data for analysis.

**🔧 Technologies Used**

SQL (MySQL, )

Database Management Systems (DBMS)

Data Cleaning Techniques (Removing duplicates, handling null values, fixing inconsistencies, standardizing values)

**📂 Dataset**

The project works with a raw dataset containing information about global employee layoffs. The dataset includes:

Company name

Industry sector

Country

Number of employees laid off

Date of layoffs

Other relevant employment details

**🔍 Cleaning Steps**

Handling Missing Values - Treated null or blank values appropriately.

Removing Duplicates - Used CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and ROW_NUMBER() to identify and remove duplicate records.

Standardizing Values - Removed special characters, trimmed values, and updated each column to ensure consistency.

Fixing Data Inconsistencies - Corrected misclassifications and typos.

Removing Unnecessary Columns - Dropped irrelevant columns to optimize dataset efficiency.

Ensuring Data Integrity - Used primary keys and constraints to maintain consistency.

**📈 Results & Insights**

After cleaning, the dataset is structured, accurate, and ready for further analysis or visualization in BI tools like Power BI or Tableau. Insights from this cleaned data can help understand trends in layoffs across industries and regions.
